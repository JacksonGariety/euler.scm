;; Problem 21
;; Amicable Numbers
;;
;; Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors
;; of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
;; If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b
;; are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called
;; amicable numbers.
;;
;; For example, the proper divisors of 220 are
;; 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110;
;; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are
;; 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142;
;; so d(284) = 220.
;;
;; Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
